# My Current Docker Stack
What I currently have deployed on my home "server" (in quotation marks because it's just a repurposed old PC)

# The Machine itself
(Yes neofetch isn't maintained anymore, no I don't mind it since I don't use it anyway) <br>

# Summary
Here's a text list of what's running and why (<ins>underlined</ins> = not running inside docker but could've)
<br><br>
**Pihole** - Mostly for AdBlocking on a network level, surprisingly works on Netflix and helps a lot with ads<br>
**Portainer** - Makes Docker easier to manage in my opinion that in the CLI, especially on mobile where SSH isn't super convenient<br>
**[Speedtest Tracker](https://docs.speedtest-tracker.dev/)** - Useful tool to see if my internet speed isn't too slow compared to what I normally get<br>
**Mute All Discord Bot (custom made)** - Like the name implies, a Discord bot to server mute/demute everyone inside a voice channel in one go instead of manually doing it. (saves a lot of time)<br>
**<ins>xmrig Proxy</ins>** - To be honest I don't have hundreds of workers mining monero, I just prefer having it to make one big worker on my pool instead of multiple with varying power.
